# magic-mock-examples
This repo contains examples of [MagicMock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html) usage for unit testing.  Feel free to fork this repo and play around with the example test cases to get a better understanding of [MagicMock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html) and its many features.

## Running Examples

You will want to install the required libraries using the following command:

```

Once installed, you can run the tests using pytest through your IDE or though CLI.
